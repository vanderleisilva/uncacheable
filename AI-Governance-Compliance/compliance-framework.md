# Compliance & Governance Framework

## Overview

This document outlines MobilityCorp's comprehensive approach to AI governance and regulatory compliance, with specific focus on the European Union's AI Act requirements. Our GenAI-powered vehicle-sharing platform is classified as a **high-risk AI system** due to its safety-critical nature in vehicle operations.

## EU AI Act Compliance

### Risk Classification

**Classification**: **High-Risk AI System** (Annex III, Category 5b - Safety Components of Vehicles)

**Rationale**:

- AI makes decisions affecting vehicle safety (anomaly detection, immobilization recommendations)
- AI influences access to critical transportation services (availability predictions, booking approvals)
- Potential impact on user safety and mobility rights

**Regulatory Requirements**: Full compliance with EU AI Act Articles 8-15 mandatory before deployment in EU markets.

## Required Controls Implementation

### 1. Risk Management System (Article 9)

**Implementation**: TEVV (Test, Evaluate, Validate, Verify) Pipeline

**Components**:

- **Test**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing for all AI components
- **Evaluate**: Performance benchmarking against accuracy, latency, and fairness metrics
- **Validate**: Shadow mode testing with real production data
- **Verify**: Canary deployments with gradual rollout and monitoring

**Risk Identification**:

- Hallucination risks (factually incorrect responses)
- Model drift (performance degradation over time)
- Prompt injection attacks
- Bias in demand forecasting or customer support
- Safety-critical false negatives (missed anomalies)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- RAG grounding to reduce hallucinations (60-80% reduction)
- Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular bias audits across demographic segments
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) gates for high-risk decisions

**Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards tracking hallucination rates, confidence scores, HITL approval rates, and model performance metrics.

---

### 2. Data Governance (Article 10)

**Training Data Management**:

- **Provenance Tracking**: All training data sources documented with lineage
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated data quality checks, outlier detection, completeness validation
- **Bias Detection**: Statistical analysis across user demographics, locations, vehicle types
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for specific AI use cases

**Data Sources**:

- Historical booking data (anonymized)
- Customer support conversation transcripts (PII removed)
- Vehicle telemetry (aggregated, no individual tracking)
- Incident reports (redacted for privacy)
- Weather and events data (external APIs)

**Privacy-Preserving Techniques**:

- No PII in LLM prompts (user IDs tokenized)
- Differential privacy for aggregate analytics
- Data anonymization for model training
- Secure multi-party computation for cross-city insights

---

### 3. Technical Documentation (Article 11)

**Required Documentation**:

- Machine-readable where possible (OpenAPI specs, JSON schemas)

---

### 4. Record-Keeping (Article 12)

**Implementation**: Immutable Audit Trail

**What Gets Logged**:

- Every AI request and response
- Model version used
- Confidence scores
- Retrieved context (RAG sources)
- HITL approvals/rejections
- User consent status
- Timestamp and correlation IDs

**Storage**:

- **Technology**: Append-only log store (e.g., AWS S3 with Object Lock, Azure Immutable Blob Storage)
- **Retention**: 90 days minimum (EU AI Act requirement), 7 years for business records
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic hashing to detect tampering

**Query Capabilities**:

- Search by user ID, session ID, model version
- Filter by confidence threshold, HITL status
- Reconstruct decision provenance for audits
- Generate compliance reports

---

### 5. Transparency & Explainability (Article 13)

**User-Facing Transparency**:

- "Powered by AI" disclosure on all AI interactions
- Citations for all AI-generated responses
- Confidence scores displayed when relevant
- Easy escalation to human support

**Explaiability Mechanisms**:

- **Natural Language Explanations**: AI generates human-readable explanations for decisions
- **Source Attribution**: RAG provides citations to knowledge base articles, historical data
- **Confidence Calibration**: Probabilistic outputs with uncertainty quantification
- **HITL Justifications**: Human reviewers document approval/rejection reasons

**Example Explainability**:

```
Q: Why was my vehicle request denied?
A: Based on your requested 2-hour rental duration and the vehicle's current
   15% battery charge, our AI predicts the battery would deplete before your
   trip ends (confidence: 92%). This decision was made to ensure your safety
   and prevent mid-trip breakdowns. [Source: Battery Prediction Model v2.3]
```

---

### 6. Human Oversight (Article 14)

**Implementation**: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Gateway

**HITL Triggers** (high-risk decisions requiring human approval):

- Vehicle immobilization due to suspected theft (safety-critical)
- Blocking user access due to safety concerns
- Overriding dynamic pricing beyond threshold
- Denying booking for charge insufficiency (edge cases)

**HITL Process**:

1. AI flags high-risk decision
2. Request queued in HITL dashboard with full context
3. Operations team reviews (target: <5 min response time)
4. Human approves, rejects, or modifies AI recommendation
5. Decision logged with justification
6. User notified of outcome

**HITL Metrics**:

- Approval rate: Track % of AI recommendations approved
- Response time: Monitor human review latency
- Override reasons: Categorize why humans disagree with AI
- Feedback loop: Use overrides to retrain models

**Staffing**: 24/7 operations center with trained staff for HITL reviews.

---
