## Model Lifecycle

### Development Phase

1. **Problem Definition**: Define business problem and success criteria
2. **Data Collection**: Gather and validate training data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features
4. **Model Training**: Train multiple candidate models
5. **Evaluation**: Benchmark against test set and fairness metrics

### Deployment Phase

6. **Runtime Validation Pipeline**: Test, Evaluate, Validate, Verify
7. **Shadow Mode**: Run in parallel with production (no user impact)
8. **Model Governance Review**: Committee approval
9. **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout (5% → 25% → 100%)
10. **Production Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking

### Maintenance Phase

11. **Drift Detection**: Monitor for model degradation
12. **Retraining**: Update models with fresh data
13. **A/B Testing**: Compare new versions against baseline
14. **Retirement**: Decommission outdated models

---

## Model Versioning

**Semantic Versioning**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., v2.3.1)

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes (new architecture, different outputs)
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible improvements (retrained on new data, hyperparameter tuning)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, configuration updates

**Version Control**:

- All models tracked in MLflow Model Registry
- Git tags for training code corresponding to model versions
- Immutable model artifacts stored in S3/Azure Blob Storage

- Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate
- Confidence score distribution

### Model Quality Metrics
