# GenAI Strategy - MobilityCorp's AI-First Competitive Edge

## Why GenAI Matters for Vehicle Sharing

Traditional vehicle-sharing platforms face a fundamental paradox: scaling operations linearly increases costs, while competitive pressure demands lower prices. GenAI breaks this cycle by automating expensive human tasks—customer support, incident analysis, safety monitoring—while actually improving quality through consistency and real-time responsiveness. However, deploying AI in safety-critical vehicle operations requires solving problems most companies ignore: preventing hallucinations, ensuring explainability, maintaining compliance, and building trust when AI makes high-stakes decisions.

## Our AI Use Cases (How We Deploy GenAI)

We deploy GenAI across three strategic domains, each with specific business impact and technical implementation. See [detailed requirements](../Problem-Context/requirements.md#genai-powered-requirements) for full specifications.

### Fleet Intelligence

ML and AI optimize vehicle positioning and battery management, transforming reactive operations into predictive planning. **Demand forecasting** predicts where and when vehicles will be needed with 80%+ accuracy, enabling proactive positioning that reduces "no vehicle available" complaints by 85%. **Rebalancing optimization** generates AI-driven crew routes that improve efficiency by 30%. **Battery intelligence** prevents charge-outs through predictive modeling and blocks bookings when charge is insufficient for the trip. **Pre-positioning** learns commuter patterns to anticipate regular users' needs, increasing repeat usage by 45%.

### Operations & Safety

GenAI transforms three critical operational workflows. **Conversational support** handles 40% of customer queries through natural language interaction grounded in official documentation, reducing response times from 15-20 minutes to under 2 seconds while maintaining 96%+ factual accuracy (see [ADR-005: RAG Strategy](../Architecture-Decision-Records/005-rag-strategy.md)). **Incident summarization** analyzes telemetry, images, and reports to generate structured summaries in under 10 seconds—10x faster than manual investigation—while identifying similar historical incidents through semantic search. **Safety anomaly detection** explains unusual vehicle behavior in natural language with risk scoring, routing high-risk situations through mandatory human approval gates.

### Customer Experience

AI personalization increases engagement without compromising privacy. **Personalized recommendations** analyze usage patterns to suggest optimal vehicle types, routes, and timing, targeting 25%+ engagement lift. **Explainable pricing** generates natural language explanations for dynamic pricing, building customer trust by making complex algorithms understandable.

## Why Our Approach Works (Competitive Differentiation)

Most companies add AI as afterthought features. We architect GenAI as a **first-class bounded context**—an isolated subsystem with its own quality controls, compliance infrastructure, and failure modes. This architectural decision enables four critical capabilities:

**Hallucination Prevention Through RAG**: Instead of relying on LLM training data that's outdated or wrong, we force every AI response to ground itself in authoritative documents we provide. Retrieval-Augmented Generation reduces hallucinations from 20-30% (bare LLM) to under 2.5% by retrieving relevant documents semantically and requiring the AI to cite its sources. This isn't just accuracy—it's legal defensibility when customers dispute AI-generated advice. See [ADR-005: RAG Strategy](../Architecture-Decision-Records/005-rag-strategy) and [RAG Data Flow](../resources/diagrams/data-flow/rag-data-flow.md) for implementation details.

**Quality Assurance Through Runtime Validation**: Every AI response passes through multiple quality gates before reaching users. Our hallucination detector cross-checks LLM outputs against retrieved facts, blocking responses with unsupported claims. Confidence calibration ensures AI uncertainty is accurately communicated, preventing overconfident wrong answers. Response validators enforce factuality thresholds (>95%) and flag low-confidence outputs for human review. Beyond runtime checks, we employ pre-deployment testing (shadow mode, canary deployments) and continuous monitoring (drift detection, performance tracking) to catch degradation early. See [GenAI Component Diagram](../resources/diagrams/genai-subsystem/genai-component-diagram.md) for the validation architecture.

**Human Oversight Through HITL**: High-risk AI decisions—vehicle immobilization, account suspension, safety alerts—route through mandatory human approval queues. The AI explains its reasoning with source citations and confidence scores, but humans make the final call. This "AI recommends, human decides" pattern satisfies EU AI Act requirements while preventing autonomous AI mistakes in safety-critical scenarios.

**Compliance Through Audit Trails**: Every AI interaction generates an immutable audit record containing the query, retrieved context, model response, confidence score, and human approval status. This creates a defensible paper trail for regulatory inquiries and customer disputes while satisfying EU AI Act Article 12 (record-keeping) and Article 13 (transparency) requirements. See [Compliance Framework](../AI-Governance-Compliance/compliance-framework.md).

## EU AI Act Risk Classification

MobilityCorp's AI system is classified as **High-Risk** under EU AI Act Annex III (safety components of products). Vehicle-sharing platforms control access to vehicles that can cause physical harm, placing them in the same regulatory category as autonomous vehicles and medical devices. This triggers mandatory requirements we implement by design:

- **Risk Management** (Article 9): Runtime validation pipeline with continuous testing and monitoring
- **Data Governance** (Article 10): Model registry tracking training data lineage and quality
- **Technical Documentation** (Article 11): Architecture Decision Records and model cards for every AI component
- **Record-Keeping** (Article 12): Immutable audit logs with 90-day retention for all AI decisions
- **Transparency** (Article 13): Source citations and confidence scores on every AI output
- **Human Oversight** (Article 14): HITL gateway for safety-critical decisions
- **Accuracy & Robustness** (Article 15): 96%+ factuality target, adversarial testing, drift monitoring

See [Compliance Framework](../AI-Governance-Compliance/compliance-framework.md) for detailed implementation and [AI Risk Classification](../AI-Governance-Compliance/compliance-framework.md#eu-ai-act-risk-classification) for regulatory mapping.

## Architecture Integration (How GenAI Fits the System)

GenAI operates as an isolated bounded context communicating with core services through events and APIs. This architectural pattern prevents AI failures from cascading to critical booking or payment flows while enabling rapid AI iteration without destabilizing the platform. The GenAI service subscribes to incident alerts and user engagement events via Kafka (see [ADR-002: Event-Driven Backbone](../Architecture-Decision-Records/003-event-driven-backbone)), processes them through RAG retrieval and LLM inference, validates outputs through hallucination detection, and publishes responses back to event streams or returns them synchronously via API Gateway.

Key architectural components:

- **RAG Pipeline**: Vector index (pgvector), embedding generator, semantic retriever
- **Model Ensemble**: LLM interface, specialized classifiers (safety, fraud), orchestrator
- **Quality Gates**: Hallucination detector, confidence calibrator, response validator
- **Governance Layer**: Audit store (immutable logs), model registry, provenance tracker
- **Human Oversight**: HITL gateway with approval queue for high-risk decisions

See [GenAI Component Diagram](../resources/diagrams/genai-subsystem/genai-component-diagram.md) for detailed component view and [Container Diagram](../resources/diagrams/container/container-diagram.md) for system integration.

## Value Proposition Summary

GenAI transforms MobilityCorp from a reactive platform into a predictive, self-optimizing system. The business case is compelling: 20% operational cost reduction per city, 40% support cost savings, 10x faster incident resolution, and 85% reduction in vehicle availability complaints—all while satisfying EU AI Act compliance requirements that competitors struggle to meet. More importantly, we achieve this through responsible AI deployment: transparent, explainable, human-overseen, and continuously validated. This combination of cost efficiency and regulatory compliance creates a sustainable competitive moat as AI regulations tighten globally.
