# Business Case

## Overview

MobilityCorp operates a **multi-modal vehicle-sharing platform** providing urban mobility solutions through electric scooters, eBikes, electric cars, and vans. As the platform scales to serve thousands of daily users across multiple cities, operational costs and service quality challenges threaten profitability and growth.

## The Problem

### Current State

Traditional vehicle-sharing platforms face critical operational challenges:

1. **Fleet Distribution & Demand Mismatch** ⭐ PRIMARY CHALLENGE

   - **"Right vehicles aren't in the right places"**: Most common customer complaint
   - Failure to anticipate demand by location, time of day, and day of week
   - Poor distribution planning: morning vs. afternoon commutes, weekdays vs. weekends
   - Reactive rebalancing: vehicles moved only after complaints, not proactively
   - No integration of external factors (weather, events, public transit disruptions)

2. **Battery & Charging Management**

   - Vehicles frequently run out of charge mid-service
   - Inefficient battery swap prioritization for scooters and eBikes
   - No predictive charge sufficiency checks before bookings
   - Field crews waste time on suboptimal battery swap routes
   - Cars and vans booked without sufficient charge for trip duration

3. **Customer Reliability & Trust**

   - Most usage is ad-hoc, not planned (e.g., daily commutes)
   - Customers don't rely on the service for regular trips due to availability uncertainty
   - Low repeat usage for specific routes or schedules
   - Difficulty converting occasional users to regular commuters
   - Trust erosion when vehicles unavailable during critical times

4. **High Support Costs**

   - Customer support teams overwhelmed with repetitive queries
   - Average response time: 15-20 minutes during peak hours
   - Support costs represent 30-40% of operational expenses
   - Inconsistent answers lead to customer frustration

5. **Slow Incident Response**

   - Safety incidents (accidents, theft, mechanical failures) require manual investigation
   - Average incident investigation time: 2-4 hours
   - Inconsistent documentation across incidents
   - Difficulty identifying patterns and root causes

6. **Reactive Fleet Operations**

   - Safety anomalies detected but not explained in real-time
   - Manual analysis required to understand fleet issues
   - Delayed response to potential theft or vandalism
   - Limited ability to predict and prevent problems

7. **Scaling Challenges**
   - Linear growth in operational costs with fleet size
   - Quality degradation as volume increases
   - Difficulty maintaining service standards across multiple cities
   - Complex compliance requirements for AI systems (especially in EU)

### Business Impact

- **Revenue Loss**: Poor customer experience leads to significant churn (estimated 15-20% annually)
- **Operational Costs**: Support and incident management consume majority of operational budget per city
- **Safety Risks**: Delayed incident response creates liability exposure
- **Competitive Pressure**: New entrants with AI-powered operations gaining market share

## The Opportunity

### Vision

Build an **AI-augmented operations platform** that reduces operational costs while improving safety, customer experience, and compliance—creating a sustainable competitive advantage through responsible AI deployment.
