# MobilityCorp - AI-Enabled Vehicle-Sharing Platform

> **O'Reilly Architecture Kata 2025** - An intelligent, scalable vehicle-sharing platform powered by GenAI for enhanced operations, safety, and customer experience.

## Executive Summary

MobilityCorp operates a multi-modal vehicle-sharing platform supporting **electric scooters, eBikes, electric cars, and vans** across urban environments. Our architecture addresses the core challenges of fleet operations, real-time safety, and customer support through an **AI-first approach** while maintaining strict compliance with EU AI Act regulations.

### The Challenge

Traditional vehicle-sharing platforms struggle with:

- **Fleet Distribution**: Right vehicles aren't in the right places at the right times
- **Demand Anticipation**: Unable to predict and proactively position fleet for customer needs
- **Battery Management**: Vehicles running out of charge, inefficient battery swap prioritization, no charge-sufficiency checks before bookings
- **Customer Reliability**: Ad-hoc usage patterns prevent building trust for regular commutes
- **Operational Costs**: High costs for customer support and incident management
- **Slow Response**: Delayed response times for safety anomalies and fleet incidents
- **AI Uncertainty**: Dealing with rapid AI model changes, price fluctuations, and provider reliability risks
- **AI Validation**: Ensuring AI functionality works correctly and detecting when AI starts misbehaving in production
- **AI Compliance**: Complex regulatory requirements for AI in safety-critical systems

### Our Solution: GenAI as a Safety-First Bounded Context

MobilityCorp delivers an **AI-augmented operations platform** that reduces costs while maintaining safety through:

**Fleet Intelligence:**

- **Demand Forecasting**: ML-powered prediction of demand by location, time, and events to position vehicles proactively
- **Rebalancing Optimization**: AI-driven route planning for fleet crews to maximize vehicle availability
- **Battery Intelligence**: Predictive charge modeling to prevent charge-outs, optimize battery swap priorities, and block bookings with insufficient charge
- **Pre-Positioning**: Anticipatory vehicle placement for regular commuters to build service reliability

**Operations & Safety:**

- **Intelligent Customer Support**: AI-powered conversational assistant handles 40% of support queries with RAG-grounded responses
- **Proactive Safety Management**: Real-time anomaly detection with natural language explanations and HITL gates
- **Automated Incident Intelligence**: 10x faster incident investigation through AI-generated summaries

**AI Quality & Governance:**

- **TEVV Pipeline**: Continuous Test, Evaluate, Validate, Verify process to detect AI misbehavior and ensure quality
- **Model Monitoring**: Real-time drift detection, hallucination tracking, and performance degradation alerts
- **Provider Resilience**: Abstraction layer for LLM providers, shadow mode testing, and graceful degradation strategies
- **Compliance by Design**: EU AI Act compliance with immutable audit trails, model registry, and human oversight

**Customer Experience:**

- **Personalized Engagement**: Tailored recommendations based on individual usage patterns to increase retention
- **Transparent Pricing**: Natural language explanations for dynamic pricing to build customer trust

**Architectural Differentiator**: Our GenAI Service operates as an **isolated, observable subsystem** with built-in safeguards‚ÄîRAG grounding prevents hallucinations, TEVV pipeline ensures quality, immutable audit trails provide compliance, and HITL gates enforce human oversight for safety-critical decisions. This bounded context approach allows us to innovate rapidly with AI while maintaining EU AI Act compliance for high-risk vehicle operations.
